requirements:

fftw3

libsndfile

libsamplerate (a.k.a. SRC)

and now libDSP 5.0.1

compile with 

make

and run with

./jack_convolve responsefile.wav

then conncect the in and out's to your liking

on my 1.2ghz athlon i can use a 1 sec response file at 30% cpu load. Make sure your
jack buffer size isn't too small, otherwise the cpu load goes up.. 

PowerPC users (or if you have some other reason that you can't use libDSP):

edit the makefile and remove the -ldsp from the LINK_FLAGS.
